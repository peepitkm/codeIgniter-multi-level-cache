## Setup

Add config variable `multi_level_cache_folders` to the `config.php` or load it directly in Controller, for example:

Example 1:
```php
$folder_array = array(2,2);
$this->config->set_item('multi_level_cache_folders', $folder_array);
```
If the cache file name is `b2690d029271df88fe87305766f95db4`, it will be stored at: `cache/b2/69/b2690d029271df88fe87305766f95db4`


Example 2:
```php
// in config.php
$config['multi_level_cache_folders'] = array(3,1,2);
```
The cache file will be stored at `cache/b26/9/0d/b2690d029271df88fe87305766f95db4`

This script will back to use origial (layer-1) folder if the config variable `multi_level_cache_folders` is not set.
